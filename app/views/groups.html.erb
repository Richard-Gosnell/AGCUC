        <h3>Sisters in Stitch Group</h3>
        <p>
            We are a small group of 7 to 10 folks who are waiting for the Covid-19 restrictions to lighten up so that we
            can meet on the 4th Saturday of each month from September to May in the lower hall.  We each bring our own
            projects to sew and quilt and enjoy exchanging ideas and learning from each other.  If you’d like to join
            us, let the office know and one of us will contact you when we get together again.  We are looking forward
            to being able to meet again.

        <p>
            Thank you to all who contributed their soup labels during the past year.  Faraday School is able to purchase
            extra school equipment because of you.

        <h3>Drink Tabs</h3>
        <p>
            The drink tabs that we’ve been collecting have been given to R.F. Morrison School in the Garden City area so
            that children in The Seven Oaks School Division can receive specialized equipment like bikes and wheelchairs
            to help them become more mobile.  Due to the pandemic, we only sent in 2 grocery bags full of tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please continue to collect drink tabs so that we may continue to help these children lead as normal a life
            as possible.
