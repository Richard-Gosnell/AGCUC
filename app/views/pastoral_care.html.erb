        <h2>Atlantic-Garden City United Church Pastoral Care</h2>
        <h5>The most wonderful places to be in the
            world are in someone's thoughts,
            someone's prayers and in someone's heart.

        <p>
            <i>Listening, Supporting, Encouraging, Befriending</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            All four words are linked to the idea of caring: <br>
            In listening, if we do not hear, we cannot help.  When one listens he or she lets the person or group know
            they are valued.  By supporting, we try to offer encouragement by our words and our actions.  Befriending,
            we hope to be a friend especially when someone is in need of help or support; through visits and calls.
            Encouraging others can make such a big difference in a person's life.  We try to encourage our church family
            and others to stay strong, stay positive and to keep the faith.</p>
        <p>
            Our minister provides leadership and support in helping pastoral care "reach out".<br>
            The pastoral care team at Atlantic Garden City United Church strives to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To be welcoming and hospitable to newcomers.</li>
            <li>To maintain regular contact with shut-ins at home or in long term care.</li>
            <li>To express care and concern for our church familiesâ€™ day to day lives.</li>
            <li>To acknowledge that pastoral care is the concern of the entire congregation.</li>
            <li>To celebrate gifts that people bring to the life of our church</li>
        </ul>
