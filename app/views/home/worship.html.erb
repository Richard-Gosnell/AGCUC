        <h2>Worship</h2>
        <h4>Come worship with us!</h4>
        <p>
            We gather each week at 10:30 a.m. on Sunday mornings, for approximately an hour, as a community of Godâ€™s
            faithful people to sing, pray, and meditate.  Our worship services follow the United Church lectionary.
            We are a friendly and inclusive group of people who enjoy hymns from the Voices United hymnbook and More
            Voices hymnbook.  We have a small choir who prepare an anthem for most Sundays.  We have several musicians,
            including a pianist, organist and guitar player as well as a few soloists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to service, worship and witness in the name of the love of Jesus.  We respect and support all
            people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender expression, sexual orientation, socio-economic background, age,
            religion and ability.
        </p>
        <p>
            We invite you to join us, to learn and grow with each of us as we work together to put our faith into
            action.
