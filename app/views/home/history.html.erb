        <h3>Atlantic Union Mission</h3>
        <p>
            In 1920, the first few meetings of the congregation were held in a tent west of the railroad tracks until a
            storm blew the tent down.  In 1921,   a committee was formed to find a suitable piece of land for a new
            building.  Part of the present site was available for back taxes, the remainder of the land was purchased
            for $10.00 a foot.  Materials were obtained and a prefabricated building was erected.  Chairs were borrowed
            and a pulpit was donated by Stella Mission.  On November 27, 1923, the first service was held in the new
            church known as the Atlantic Union Mission.

        <h3>Atlantic Avenue United Church</h3>
        <p>
            In 1926, the vision of a permanent structure was introduced.  This was a giant undertaking for the
            congregation. Funds had to be raised and plans for a new church studied.  It was decided to go ahead with
            the new building and in the fall of 1927, another milestone in our history was the laying of the cornerstone
            for the present structure.  On December 7, 1927, the church was completed and on December 11, 1927, the
            opening service and dedication was held in the new building as it stands today.  We were now Atlantic Avenue
            United Church.  Our first minister was Rev. Robert Frayne who served until 1935.

        <p>In 1930, the Sunday School had 30 teachers with an average attendance per Sunday of 184 children.  The
            highest attendance of 307 was recorded on Mother's Day.

        <h3>The Manse</h3>
        <p>
            In 1950, a manse was built at 721 Atlantic Avenue, next door to the church.  During the 1970's, this
            building ceased to be used as a manse and became a Christian Education facility.  It was sold in 2000.

        <h3>Garden City United Church</h3>
        <p>
            As homes were being built in the Garden City area, people there began planning for a church to serve them.
            In 1962, a portable building was moved from Windsor Park to a site at Airlies and Merriwood to be used as a
            church.  It was known as Garden City United Church.  Unfortunately, due to a lack of finances and support,
            the final service was held on June 8, 1967.  The Garden City United Church congregation then amalgamated
            with the Atlantic Avenue United Church congregation and the new name of the church was Atlantic-Garden City
            United Church.

        <h3>Maples</h3>
        <p>In September, 1982, under the leadership of Mrs. Rose Ferries, the Maples congregation was formed and held
            worship services and church school in O. V. Jewitt School.  In August, 1989, they merged with the
            Atlantic-Garden City United Church congregation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The church school and mid-week programs have continued with strong support from dedicated leaders.  In
            recent years, the building has undergone changes to update and modernize the facilities.  It became
            handicap accessible, with the installation of an elevator in 2011.

            For over ninety-four years, God has given us direction.  We pray that God will bless us as we continue our
            faith journey.
