        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Atlantic-Garden City United Church (AGCUC) is a welcoming community of faith that is inclusive of all people
            . Our congregation has been working and worshiping together since it's first few meetings in 1920.  With the
            addition of a new elevator to our building in 2011, most areas are now accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through acts of charity, calls for justice and acts of compassion and love, our congregation shows it's
            willingness to be active in our world and demonstrates its faith in so many different ways.  Our world
            changes from day to day and AGCUC strives to grow and evolve along with it.  We are currently going through
            the process to become officially recognized as an affirming ministry.  With the move to online worship
            necessitated by the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, we have been looking at new ways to share
            the Word.  We are now in the process of reaching out to rural ministries through our Rural Connect program,
            an interactive worship program connecting other congregations with our own via the wonders of technology
            (Click the link below for more information).
