        <h5>Minister</h5>
        <p>
            In my late teens, I felt the call to ministry.  Like Jonah, I immediately ran the other way.  Unlike Jonah,
            I have never been swallowed up by a large fish.  I was, however, almost swallowed up by my fear of standing
            up in front of a group of people and speaking.  It took me 37 years, and many more calls from God before I
            gave in, went back to school to attain my Master of Divinity and enter into Ordained ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
            For five years, while I was in school, I was blessed to serve as a student minister at St. Paul’s United
            Church in Graysville, Manitoba.  Upon ordination in June 2019, I was called to full-time ministry here at
            Atlantic-Garden City United Church, beginning in July of that year.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in a God who loves, a God who lives in relationship with creation and humanity, a God who
            includes.  My theology is built on a foundation of Matthew 22:36-40 where Jesus gives his answer to the
            question, ‘what is the greatest commandment?’
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you will join us for worship and community.  I look forward to meeting you.

        <h3>Mackayla Taylor</h3>
        <h5>Young At Hearts Club Leader</h5>
        <p>
            Mackayla started working with our Young at Hearts Club in November 2020.  As it was right in the middle of
            this pandemic, she hasn't been able to have an in-person gathering yet.  Instead, she has been preparing
            virtual activities for our younger members each week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mackayla will be finishing grade ten in June 2021.  She has had many past experiences with kids as she has
            been a part of the church family, helping the Sunday School program any chance she had.  She hopes to
            graduate from high school, and head to University and/or College to study Forensic Investigations or
            Criminal Justice.  She also takes part in programs around the city, which include Film production and other
            experiences in that area.
